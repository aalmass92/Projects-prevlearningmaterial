sequence interger flow

1st. takes parameter off the stack and loads it into eax
2nd. adds parameter to eax and stores the result in edi
3nd which final value as a single parameter to the memory allocation routine mmaloc.
4th. if parameter on the stack is signed, eax contains a very high number which close to the high range because we add a parameter which would create interger over flow and we would end up wth a very low positive value.
